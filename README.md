# M2 Lab 2 – Employee Management System (DOM & Events)

This lab focuses on working with the DOM, handling form events, and collecting user input using JavaScript.

## Overview
The Employee Management System demonstrates how to:
- Handle the `window` load event
- Attach event listeners to a form
- Prevent default form submission behavior
- Collect and process user input from form fields
- Output form data to the browser console

## Features Implemented
- Employee form with validation using HTML attributes
- Form submission handled via JavaScript
- Console logging of:
  - Employee ID
  - Full Name
  - Extension
  - Email
  - Department
- Use of strict mode and arrow functions

## Running the Lab
1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**, **Brackets**, or any code editor.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Use **Live Server**, **Live Preview**, or open the file directly in a browser.

## Output
- Form data is displayed in the **browser console** using `console.log()`.
- The page does not reload on submission due to `preventDefault()`.
